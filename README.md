Business Analyst Python Assignment – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the role of a business analyst in exploring real-world datasets and communicating findings effectively. The objective was to analyze a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and explain both the analysis and insights in a way that a junior business analyst could understand.

The work was completed in-class, ensuring a focus on hands-on application of data analysis methods discussed during lectures.

🔎 Dataset Options

Two datasets were available for exploration:

Online Retail Data – Transactions between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based online retailer. Dataset Link

Wholesale Customers Data – Sales data across product categories for wholesale distributor clients. Dataset Link

The chosen dataset for this analysis is documented inside the notebook.

📈 Analysis Process
1. Data Preprocessing

Loaded dataset directly from the cloud into Google Colab.

Checked and handled missing values, errors, and inconsistencies.

Converted column data types where necessary for analysis.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Generated summary statistics for all attributes.

Created visualizations (histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, correlation heatmaps) to highlight key patterns.

Examined outliers and trends across variables.

3. Insights & Interpretation

Identified key patterns in purchasing behavior.

Analyzed customer/product segments to understand variability.

Discussed anomalies and potential business implications.

Provided actionable insights suitable for decision-making.

🗂️ Deliverables

Python_Assignment_A1.ipynb – Well-commented Python notebook with:

Full code workflow (imports, data loading, EDA, visualizations).

500–2000 words of narrative explaining the code, analysis, and insights.

Clear formatting with markdown cells for readability.

Dataset(s) – CSV/JSON file(s) used for analysis, uploaded for Colab compatibility.

🚀 Key Takeaways

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is essential for identifying patterns and preparing data for deeper modeling.

Handling missing values and outliers ensures data quality and reliability of insights.

Effective communication of findings (via both visuals and narrative) is just as important as the technical analysis.

This project demonstrates how a business analyst can bridge data analysis and business storytelling.
